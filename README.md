# AI-Powered Task Scheduling Assistant

PriorityOS is an AI-native productivity tool that helps you **turn your mental clutter into an executable schedule**. Just dump your tasks in plain language, and PriorityOS will automatically **parse, prioritize, and schedule them into your calendar** based on your availability and preferences.

---

## Problem

Modern professionals are overwhelmed by scattered tasks spread across notes, messages, and memory. Traditional to-do lists help capture tasks but don't help you **act** on them. Manual prioritization and scheduling are mentally draining and often skipped—leading to missed deadlines, burnout, and underperformance.

---

## Solution

PriorityOS acts like your personal executive assistant. It:
- Accepts freeform task input (e.g. “email Sarah, finish report, book dentist”)
- Automatically structures and ranks tasks based on urgency, time sensitivity, and user-defined preferences
- Schedules them directly into your calendar (Google Calendar support in MVP)
- Adapts when your day shifts and lets you re-prioritize on the fly
